    <p id="Clarification">When I say this math is easy, I do not mean to offend
    <br> anyone who does not know this math, such as toddlers,
    <br> or infants. I'm just saying that this math is easy for me.
    <br>I do not mean to offend people who do not know this
    <br> basic math. The NOOTAI (National Organization Of
    <br>Toddlers And Infants) say to all toddlers and infants
    <br>to not be offended because it is nothing to be offended
    <br> about. I really do not want the NOOTAI to wage war on
    <br> me, so do not be offended, toddlers and infants.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Actually, the NOOTAI is not real, so I don't have to worry
    <br>about them waging war on me, but seriously, do not be
    <br> offended, infants and toddlers. XD
    <br>JK toddlers go and be angry XD

    <h2 id="addition">Addition</h2>
        <p>Addition is combining numbers together. This is addition:
        <br> If I have one candy and you give me 2 candies,
        <br>how many candies do I have now? The answer is obviously
        <br> 3 candies. Here are some super easy addition problems
        <br>for you to try out.
        </p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>1+1</li>
            <li>2+4</li>
            <li>1+5</li>
            <li>7+3</li>
            <li>4+9</li>
            <li>3+2</li>
            <li>5+7</li>
            <li>8+1</li>
            <li>4+4</li>
            <li>7+1</li>
            <li>0+4</li>
            <li>5+3</li>
        </ul>
        
    <h2 id="subtraction">Subtraction</h2>
        <p>Subtraction is taking part of a number away. This is subtraction:
        <br>If I have two  candies and I give you one candy, how many candies
        <br>do I have now? The answer is obviously 1 candy. Here are some
        <br>easy subtraction problems for you to do.
        </p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>1-1</li>
            <li>6-2</li>
            <li>7-1</li>
            <li>3-2</li>
            <li>4-4</li>
            <li>9-7</li>
            <li>8-3</li>
            <li>5-2</li>
            <li>7-3</li>
            <li>8-4</li>
            <li>7-6</li>
            <li>1-0</li>
            <li>3-2</li>
            
        </ul>
        
    <h2 id="multiplication">Multiplication</h2>
        <p>Muliplication is repeating addition. For example, If I have 6 dollars,
        <br>and you triple my money, how much money do I now have? The
        <br>answer is 18, because 6 tripled is 18. Now, you try your hand at
        <br> multplication problems.
